# Correspondence_Server
This repository contains the code for the R3DMCS Flask server, available
at http://rna.bgsu.edu/correspondence
The RNA 3D Motif Correspondence Server allows querying RNA 3D motifs or specific nucleotide sets in an RNA-containing PDB structure. It then identifies corresponding nucleotides in other structures of the same molecule type from the same species or different species. The results are presented in a table based on geometric similarity, with more similar instances grouped together. An interactive heatmap with a 3D viewer visually displays the geometric differences between the motif instances. The formation of separate clusters in the heatmap may indicate variable motif geometries linked to biological function or ligand binding. R3DMCS is pronounced "Red Max".
